# prtsn. mobile (Expo)

The Expo scaffold mirrors the web appâ€™s core flows for feed, debate, campaigns, and impact tracking.

## Getting started
```bash
npm install --global expo-cli
cd mobile
npm install
npm run start
```

Open the Expo Go app on iOS or Android and scan the QR code. Screens live under `mobile/app/` using Expo Router.
